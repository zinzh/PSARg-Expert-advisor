#Features

PSARg will place buy and sell orders based on the Parabolic SAR indicator, tweaked to eliminate false positives.

You can adjust the order it takes based on which candle the price is currently into and wether the candle is red or green
Additionally, it can close the order to secure profits after a certain retracement % from the absolute high of the price

PSARg can be used on any chart symbol, but it is recommended to use it with indexes such as US100 Nasdaq and Dow jones
